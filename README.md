# Cart

I want to learn Elixir and Phoenix using the umbrella architecture, currently I know React but I don't feel
comfortable with my code so I want to learn Recompose because maybe it can
help me to understand how Elm works.

And because of that I want to create a module for one of my personal
projects and that is a cart.

#### Module
the_cart app, contains the websockets and the render for our web which is a
server render using React(with Recompose),Elm and if I want to learn a new UI, I
can implement here.


**TODO: Steps during my learning. **
[] Learn Recompose (thats why our first demo should work with react)
  [] Setup the React project
  [] Create a High
  
[] Learn ELM

### Chronology
> 23/JUN/2018 I accept the challenge.
